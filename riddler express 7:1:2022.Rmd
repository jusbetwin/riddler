It's the morning of Jan. 1, 2023, and you have a task you want to complete before the
end of the year, on Dec. 31. The task is easily divisible into portions, so you always
know exactly what fraction of the task is left.

Your initial plan is to do exactly 1/365 of the task every day. But then you think to
yourself, "If I do 2/365 today, I can do a little less every day from now on." And so, on
Jan. 1, you would complete 2/365 of the task. On Jan. 2, 363/365 of the task remains
with 364 days left to complete it, so you would do another 2/364 Ã— 363/365 of the
task.

If you continue in this fashion every day, dividing the remaining work by the
remaining number of days in the year and doing twice that amount, when would you
finish?

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

days_left = 365
work_left = 1.00

while (work_left > 0) {
  
  work_left = 2 / days_left * work_left
  days_left = days_left - 1
  
}

print(365 - days_left)
```
